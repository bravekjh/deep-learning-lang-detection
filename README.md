# Deep Learning Programming Language Detection
Deep Learning using Keras (and Tensorflow) to detect programming language of a file or code snippet

## Purpose
The project is set up to demonstrate - in simple steps - how to use Keras to build a Deep Learning (DL) model to reconise programming language of a file or a code snippet.
